        <h1 class="title">Logistics - FraserHacks</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          FraserHacks is a large event! As such, we are looking for hardworking and
          motivated individuals to help us organize and host FraserHacks.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          We understand that applicants may have other priorities, but we ask that you
          are able to work at least 2 hours a week to complete your assigned task(s) and
          completely prioritize FraserHacks near the event launch date to ensure that
          everything is working smoothly.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h3>What you will be working on</h3>

          You&#x27;ll help us choose from a myriad of event venues, work with John

          snacks, schedule the event and organize workshops.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          While meetings to discuss progress and need for collaboration between
          assignees will be held occasionally, the bulk of the work will require you to
          complete it in your own free time.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>

          <li>Good teamwork and communication skills are a must-see</li>
          <li>Planning and organizational skills</li>

            and deliver effectively
          </li>
          <li>
            Experience organizing and hosting large-scale (150+ people for over 8
            hours!) events a plus
