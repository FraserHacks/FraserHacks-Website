        <p>In accordance with school regulations, every <b>FraserHacks</b> team must have a teacher supervisor.</p>

        <br>

        <p> There is a
            maximum
            of 20 students, or 5 teams, per teacher. Please talk to a teacher or administration member to supervise your
            schoolâ€™s teams by filling out the teacher application.</p>

        <br>

        <p><b>Teacher and school</b> registrations can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1fQkFuEvncN8SAJVW_mTj0JW-ldL_tBjZQVGKFGsuyLHRpg/viewform">here</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After your teacher has filled out the application, you may register for the event as a <b>hacker</b>

        <p>
            If you are unable to find a teacher supervisor but still would like to attend FraserHacks, please register
            for the event but indicate that you were unable to find a supervisor. We may be able to pair you under a
            teacher from another school.
